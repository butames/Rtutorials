# Rtutorials

I have created this repository to support my ongoing work with R (and R Studio).

## File Structure

Each tutorial has its own `.qmd` (i.e., qaurto markdown document), which is the Posit's format for storing their unique flavor of markdown in Quarto. All the data used in these tutorials is stored in data folder with the following structure. Similarly, images shown here are stored in an img folder with the following structure.
